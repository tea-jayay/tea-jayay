Hi there!

21 y/o self-taught programmer focusing on Java and C#.

English Lit major by day, aspiring game dev by night.

Mostly making desperate attempts at game development, but I'm also doing some Minecraft modding to help
solidify my confidence w/ Java. Also do pixel art! ðŸŽ¨ There's nowhere you can see any of it at time of writing
(because I'm too lazy to consolidate things) but that may change.

That's all for now - doubt anyone will need to get in touch but if you do, pop me an email. Take care <3
